For now it opens the videos in a new browser window, although it would not be hard to change this so it displays the video in a pop-up window within the app.

To add an overview video, add a "constants" section, similar to this:

srw-schema.json:
{
    "constants": {
        "helpVideoURL": "https://vimeo.com/184677009"
    },
    ...

That link will appear under the help menu:

 


To add a video to the modal dialogs, add a "helpVideoURL" attribute to the view which will be shown in the panel heading, for example:
srw-schema.json:
        "undulator": {
            "title": "Idealized Undulator",
            "helpVideoURL": "https://vimeo.com/184677009",
            "basic": [],
            "advanced": [
              ...
